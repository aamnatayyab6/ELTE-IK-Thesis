\chapter{Backend Documentation}
\label{appx:backend_doc}
\begin{appendix}
This appendix serves as a comprehensive documentation resource for the backend of the mobile app and the web app created for the administration of the mobile app. It provides detailed information about the architecture, functionality, and implementation of the backend systems supporting the mobile app's core features all implemented by my colleague, Timilehin Bisola-Ojo. Additionally, you will find complete API documentation, outlining the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods for seamless integration with the app. Furthermore, this appendix includes an overview of the database structure, schemas, and relationships, offering insights into the data management and storage aspects of the application. This documentation serves as a valuable reference for developers and users involved in understanding the backend infrastructure of the mobile app.
