\label{ch:sum}

The development of the Study Buddy application has been a rich, learning-filled journey. Motivated by the challenges students face in online education due to COVID-19, our goal was to provide a platform that eases the process of forming study groups.

From its initial conception to its current state, the process has been both demanding and rewarding. Recognition at the online UI hackathon was a motivating factor, reaffirming our belief in the app's potential.

Through testing, we identified various improvements, such as real-time image updates, reducing unnecessary API calls, and the need for real-time messaging. We also learned the importance of incorporating certain tools, like 'Storage.js', earlier in development.

As we move forward, user feedback and testing outcomes will guide our enhancements to the app. We plan to introduce real-time messaging, improve logout functionality, and refine user data handling with async storage.

In summary, the experience of building Study Buddy has deepened our understanding of app development and highlighted the importance of continuous improvement. Our journey is a testament to how motivated individuals can create meaningful solutions to real-world challenges, and we hope our work contributes to the evolving discourse on digital education.
