% In case your thesis received financial support from a project or the university, it is usually required to indicate the proper attribution in the thesis itself. Special thanks can also be expressed towards teachers, fellow students and colleagues who helped you in the process of creating your thesis.
Prima facie, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Allah, my family, my friends and roommates who have contributed to the completion of my Bachelor's thesis in Computer Science. Their constant support and encouragement have been invaluable throughout this journey.

I would like to thank my thesis supervisor, Dr. Rudolf Szendrei, for his unwavering guidance. His expertise, patience and insightful feedback has been crucial to the entire process. 

I extend my sincere thanks to the faculty members at the Faculty of Informatics at Eötvös Loránd University. Their dedication to teaching has encouraged me to be a better student.

I am thankful to my friends and fellow students who provided me with valuable insights during the course of my research. Their feedback and suggestions were instrumental in shaping my ideas and improving the overall quality of this work. 

I had the pleasure of collaborating with Timilehin Bisola-Ojo. Working alongside him has been an enriching experience, and I am thankful for his dedication. Together, we have navigated challenges, brainstormed ideas, and supported each other, creating a dynamic and fruitful partnership.

Although it is not possible to name everyone who has contributed to this thesis individually, I am sincerely grateful for the support and assistance provided by all those involved.
